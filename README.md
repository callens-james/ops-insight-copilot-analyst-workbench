# Ops Insight Copilot (Analyst Workbench)

Local-first analyst dashboard that converts raw operations exports into:
- KPI trends
- anomaly alerts
- prioritized recommendations
- weekly executive brief
- audit/export artifacts

## Why I built this
I built this to solve a common operations pain: analysts spend too much time manually cleaning exports, calculating KPIs, and writing status summaries. The objective was a local-first workbench that turns raw data into clear decisions faster and more consistently.

## Why this project exists
Ops teams often export CSVs from support/CRM systems and then manually clean, analyze, and summarize. This tool standardizes that flow and speeds decision-making with human-in-the-loop controls.

## How teams can use this
- Weekly operations reporting for support/sales/customer teams
- Early anomaly detection with explainable thresholds
- Action planning with priority recommendations and approval controls
- Exportable briefs and CSV outputs for leadership updates and handoffs

## Core capabilities
1. **CSV upload + validation**
2. **Auto-normalization** from multiple source formats:
 - normalized metrics CSV
 - support ticket export
 - CRM lead export
 - ops queue export
3. **KPI computation** (avg/min/max/count)
4. **Anomaly detection** (threshold-based, explainable)
5. **Recommendation generation** (priority + rationale)
6. **Approval + Undo** for recommendations
7. **Weekly brief generation**
8. **CSV exports + audit logging**
